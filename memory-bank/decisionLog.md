# Decision Log

**Initialization Timestamp:** 4/28/2025, 3:32:10 PM (UTC)

## Decisions Made
- User requested switching to Architect mode to initialize the Memory Bank.
- Decided to change the Supabase connection from direct to use a session pooler.
- Completed the planning phase for a session pooler implementation.
- Implemented a local PgBouncer session pooler.
- Decided to revise the implementation to use Supabase's managed Supavisor pooler.
- User approved the revised plan for using Supavisor.
- Successfully completed the revised implementation phase using Supavisor.

## Rationale
- The `memory-bank/` directory existed but was missing mandatory files, indicating an incomplete initialization.
- Direct Supabase connections are not IPv4 compatible, necessitating the use of a session pooler.
- Supabase recommends using their managed Supavisor pooler over a self-hosted PgBouncer, and the connection method is different.
- The revised plan addresses the user's requirement to use the recommended Supabase pooler and connection method.

## Alternatives Considered
- Maintaining direct connections (rejected due to IPv4 compatibility).
- Continuing with the local PgBouncer implementation (rejected as Supabase recommends Supavisor).
