**Last Updated:** 4/27/2025, 3:54:32 PM (Asia/Singapore, UTC+8:00)

- Decided to attempt Memory Bank initialization upon entering Architect mode as per rules.
- Decided to proceed with code summarization without Memory Bank after initial directory creation failure.
- Decided to re-attempt Memory Bank initialization based on user feedback.
- Decided to check allowed directories for `filesystem` tool after initial failure.
- Decided to use absolute path with backslashes for directory creation after checking allowed directories.
- Decided to switch to Code mode to fulfill user request for creating development stack files.
- Decided to use absolute paths for creating `backend_app` directory and reading Memory Bank files due to previous errors with relative paths using the `filesystem` tool.
- Decided to create a basic `main.py` before the `Dockerfile` as the Dockerfile needs to copy it.
- Decided to update Memory Bank files before editing the main README as requested by the user.
- Decided to switch to Code mode to add `ufw` instructions to the setup script based on user request.
- Decided to insert `ufw` commands after Docker installation verification in `setup_do_droplet.sh`.
- Decided to update Memory Bank files after modifying the setup script.
- Decided to switch to Code mode to remove Docker installation steps from setup script based on user feedback.
- Decided to remove lines 13-43 (Docker install steps) and replace with verification steps in `setup_do_droplet.sh`.
- Decided to update Memory Bank files after modifying the setup script again.
